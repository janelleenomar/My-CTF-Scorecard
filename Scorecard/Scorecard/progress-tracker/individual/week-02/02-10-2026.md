### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

I validated my proficiency in Static Analysis by successfully clearing 3 Easy and 1 Medium challenge. This wasn't just about getting flags; it was a deliberate stress test to confirm I have truly mastered the workflow for strings.exe and exiftool.

**What challenged you?**

I am still hitting a wall with HxD and binary analysis. I started my plan to "learn it slowly," but the interface and the logic of manipulating raw hex bytes remain confusing. Shifting my mindset from reading text to interpreting hexadecimal values is proving to be a steeper learning curve than I expected.

**Key learning:**

There is a distinct gap between "Text Forensics" (Strings/Exiftool) and "Binary Forensics" (HxD). Mastering the former does not automatically help with the latter. I learned that I need to treat HxD not just as a tool, but as a new language I am trying to read.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

I will maintain my focus on mastering HxD. I need to break this down further—perhaps by simply comparing a "good" file and a "bad" file side-by-side in the editor to see the differences, rather than trying to solve a complex puzzle immediately.
