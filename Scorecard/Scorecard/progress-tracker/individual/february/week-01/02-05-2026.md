### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

Officially started my training by completing the "Intro to Digital Forensics" room on TryHackMe. I successfully navigated the platform and completed the initial practical tasks.

**What challenged you?**

I struggled significantly with the command line syntax, often not knowing which specific commands were required to execute a task. I also faced difficulty in simply locating and retrieving the necessary practice files within the environment, which slowed down my progress.

**Key learning:**

Understood the core lifecycle of a digital forensics investigation: Preservation, Analysis, and Reporting. I learned why the Chain of Custody is critical for legal integrity and how digital evidence must be handled to prevent contamination during the acquisition phase.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

Setting up my local development environment by installing necessary tools (specific forensic tools) so I don't have to rely solely on browser-based VMs.
