### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

I successfully transitioned from basic tutorials to solving 7 specific CTF challenges. Crucially, I moved away from browser-based VMs and set up my own local forensic environment by installing strings.exe, exiftool.exe, and HxD directly on my PC. I have already built strong muscle memory with the CLI tools (strings and exiftool), allowing me to quickly extract hidden metadata and flag patterns.

**What challenged you?**

I hit a technical wall with Binary Analysis and Hex Editing. While I can handle text-based hidden data, I struggled with challenges that required manipulating raw file bytes using HxD. I realized that when a file is "corrupt" or has no readable strings, my current toolkit (Strings/Exiftool) isn't enough.

**Key learning:**

Files are just sequences of bytes. Tools like strings only show me the human-readable parts, but a Hex Editor (HxD) reveals the entire file structure, including the "Magic Bytes" (file signatures) that define what a file actually is. To advance, I need to get comfortable looking at raw hex code rather than just text.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

Bridge the gap in my Static Analysis skills by mastering HxD. I will focus on learning File Signatures (Magic Bytes) to fix corrupt headers and then potentially start my first Network Forensics module with Wireshark.
