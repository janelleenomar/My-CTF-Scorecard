### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

I successfully solved the "MacroHard WeakEdge" challenge, which required me to investigate hidden file structures. A major win was discovering DevToys, a powerful offline alternative to CyberChef. I found its interface for decoding Base64 more intuitive and it offers a suite of developer tools I plan to integrate into my workflow. I also mastered the essential skill of revealing "Hidden Items" within the Windows File Explorer to locate concealed evidence.

**What challenged you?**

I hit a technical wall when attempting to solve a specific challenge involving HxD (Hex Editor). Despite my efforts to analyze the file, I couldn't interpret the raw binary data or figure out the correct byte manipulation required to solve it. The sheer volume of hexadecimal values was overwhelming compared to text-based decoding tools, and I ultimately had to set the challenge aside. It was a stark contrast to the ease of using high-level tools like DevToys.

**Key learning:**

I learned that forensic analysis often requires going "offline" and "under the hood." While tools like DevToys handle the logical decoding, true forensics often happens at the byte level. I also realized that my struggle with HxD isn't a failure, but a sign that I need to slow down and study file structures (headers/footers) fundamentally before trying to rush into patching files.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

I will take a step back from solving challenges to focus purely on learning the HxD interface. I plan to start slowly by just opening known files (like a normal JPG) in HxD to understand what "normal" looks like before trying to fix "broken" ones.
