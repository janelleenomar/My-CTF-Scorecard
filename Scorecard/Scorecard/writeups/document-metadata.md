# 📝 Challenge Write-up: Document Metadata

| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Target File** | `ransom-letter.pdf` |

## 1. The Challenge Scenario
We were provided with a **PDF document** recovered during an investigation. The objective was to determine the original **Author** or **Creator** of the file to establish attribution. This information is often hidden in the file's **metadata properties** and is not visible in the text itself.

## 2. The Step-by-Step Solution
To solve this, I used the command-line tool **`pdfinfo`**, which is designed to extract metadata specifically from PDF documents.

**Step 1:** I located the target file in the directory.

**Step 2:** I executed the following command to view the document's properties:

```bash
pdfinfo ransom-letter.pdf
```

**Step 3:** I analyzed the output, looking for the `Author`, `Creator`, or `Producer` fields.

## 3. The Findings
The tool successfully extracted the hidden metadata:

**Target Found:** `Ann Gree Shepherd`

## 4. Conclusion
This task demonstrated that **document metadata** is a critical source of evidence. Even if a user claims they did not write a document, the metadata (often automatically generated by the software) can reveal the **registered owner** of the software or the original author's name.
